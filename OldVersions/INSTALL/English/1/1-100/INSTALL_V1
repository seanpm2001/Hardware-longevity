Seanpm2001-Hardware-longevity currently doesn't require installation, it is just a collection of documentation and data.

If you want to load the project language file, you will need to have C (language) installed (versions from the year 1970 or higher)

If you want to view the image files, the majority of files are in JPG format. Make sure your computer can handle images of 2560x1440/2560x1080 resolution well, and that your computer can handle JPG files.

Some image files are in other formats, such as SVG, and PNG. You will need support for viewing these files to view these files.

Some included files are in Markdown format (*.md) for best viewing, you should use a markdown viewer/markdown editor.

Some included files are in PDF format. They should be opened with a document viewer capable of handling PDF documents.
